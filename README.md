AES-SHA1

Building

The source code for each algorithm will come in a pair of a source code file and a header file. There should be no inter-header file dependencies, no additional libraries, no platform-specific header files, or any other complicating matters. Compiling them should be as easy as adding the relevent source code to the project.
